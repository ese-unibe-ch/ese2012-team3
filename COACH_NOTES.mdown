# Coach Review Preview
## Code Quality
* Non-semantic class names in view
* Good use of `@error` hash
* Inline style definition e.g. in `strongpass.erb`
* Good route design and use of `before`
* Password check seems very complex, do you need these criteria?
* Generally very ruby-ish 

## Testing
* Very cool selenium tests
* Good tests for model
* No functional tests for controller. This is somewhat ok, since integration
  tests in the selenium run the controllers as well.
